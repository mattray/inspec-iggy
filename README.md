# Description #

[![Build Status Master](https://travis-ci.org/inspec/inspec-iggy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/inspec/inspec-iggy)

InSpec-Iggy (InSpec Generate -> "IG" -> "Iggy") is an [InSpec](https://inspec.io) plugin for generating compliance controls and profiles from [Terraform](https://terraform.io) ```tfstate``` files. Iggy generates InSpec AWS controls by mapping Terraform resources to InSpec resources. You may also use tags to annotate your Terraform scripts to specify which compliance profiles to be used and Iggy will create a profile including those dependencies.

Iggy was originally a stand-alone CLI inspired by Christoph Hartmann's [inspec-verify-provision](https://github.com/chris-rock/inspec-verify-provision) and the blog post on testing [Terraform with InSpec](http://lollyrock.com/articles/inspec-terraform/).

The [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/mattray/iggy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) covers current, previous and future development milestones and contains the features backlog.

# Requirements #

Iggy generates compliance profiles for InSpec 2, which includes the AWS and Azure resources. Because resources are continuing to be added to InSpec, you may want the latest version to support as many resource coverage as possible.

Written and tested with Ruby 2.4.4 (or whatever InSpec 2.0 supports).

# Installation #

`inspec-iggy` is a plugin for InSpec and may be installed as follows

```bash
# install InSpec
gem install inspec
gem install inspec-iggy
inspec terraform version
```

## * for development: ##

```bash
# Install `inspec-iggy` via a symlink:
git clone git@github.com:inspec/inspec-iggy ~/inspec-iggy
mkdir -p ~/.inspec/plugins
ln -s ~/inspec-iggy/ ~/.inspec/plugins/inspec-iggy
inspec terraform version
```

## * or build a gem: ##

```bash
# Build the `inspec-iggy` then install:
git clone https://github.com/inspec/inspec-iggy && cd inspec-iggy && gem build *gemspec && gem install *gem
inspec terraform version
```

# InSpec Terraform Generate #

     inspec terraform generate --tfstate terraform.tfstate

Iggy dynamically pulls the available AWS resources from InSpec and attempts to map them to the Terraform resources. Newer versions of InSpec may provide additional coverage.

# InSpec Terraform Extract (EXPERIMENTAL)#

    inspec terraform extract --tfstate terraform.tfstate

## Tagging Profiles for Extract ##

Compliance profiles are added to the Terraform Resource to be tested. The current 2 options are the ```aws_vpc``` or the ```aws_instance```. By tagging the ```aws_vpc``` you are specifying that the test is against the AWS API rather than individual machines. AWS instances tagged with compliance profiles will attempt to form command lines for ```inspec exec``` against them.

### Tagging Format ###

Given there is not support for lists within AWS tags, we use the convention of starting our tag names with ```inspec_name_``` and ```inspec_url_```. These are extracted and split to identify the relevant compliance profiles to run.

```
tags {
    iggy_name_apache_baseline = "apache-baseline",
    iggy_url_apache_baseline = "https://github.com/dev-sec/apache-baseline",
    iggy_name_linux_baseline = "linux-baseline",
    iggy_url_linux_baseline = "https://github.com/dev-sec/linux-baseline"
}
```

### Potential Enhancements ###

The current tagging for extraction implementation is directly tied to AWS. Other platforms such as Azure undoubtedly behave differently. Longterm this functionality should probably be turned into a Terraform Provider with predefined outputs.

Subnet might be a better choice for tagging than VPCs, given they list the AZ.

Currently it only supports URL-based compliance profiles. InSpec supports other formats (git, path, supermarket, compliance).

inspec exec https://github.com/dev-sec/linux-baseline -t ssh://clckwrk@52.33.203.34 -i ~/.ssh/mattray-apac

# CloudFormation Support #

**CloudFormation support has been started, but it is incomplete while focusing on Terraform.** Here is an example of the current output, note that it's not tied to an actual deployed CloudFormation Stack, so that will need to be provided for the entry point of testing.

# Testing #

Iggy uses [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) for testing. You should run the following before committing.

    $ rspec

For style Iggy uses [InSpec's .rubocop.yml](https://github.com/inspec/inspec/blob/master/.rubocop.yml)

    $ rubocop .
